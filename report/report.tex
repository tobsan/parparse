\chapter{Background}

\section{Introduction}
The topic of this thesis is to do \textbf{parsing} in an \textbf{incremental}
fashion that can easily be parallelizable. To parse is a to check if some given
input corresponds to a certain language's grammar, and in this case context-free
programming languages' grammars.

% What is the topic? Describe each word in the title.
% Something like a motivation on why this is interesting at all.
\subsection{Incrementality}
Doing something incrementally means that one does it step by step, and not
longer than neccessary.

\subsection{Parallelism}
\subsection{Parsing}
\subsection{Motivation}
In compilers, lexing and parsing are the two first phases. The output of these
is an abstract syntax tree (AST) which is fed to the next phase of the compiler.
But an AST could also provide useful feedback for programmers, already in their
editor, if the code could be lexed and parsed fast enough. With a lexer and
parser that is incremental and that can also be parallelized could real-time
feedback in the form of an AST easily be provided to the programmer. Most
current text editors give syntax feedback based on regular expressions, which
does not yield any information about depth or the surrounding AST.

\section{Lexing}
Shortly describe LexGen and its relevance.
