\chapter{Background}

\section{Introduction}
The topic of this thesis is to do \textbf{parsing} in an \textbf{incremental}
fashion that can easily be \textbf{parallelizable}, using a
\textbf{divide-and-conquer approach}. In this section, I will give a brief
explanation of the topics covered, and end with a motivation for why this is
interesting to do in the first place.

\subsection{Divide-and-conquer}
Add stuff here from section 2 in parparse paper.

\subsection{Incrementality}
Doing something incrementally means that one does it step by step, and not
longer than neccessary.

\subsection{Parallelism}
Why is parallelism interesting and how does it apply in this case?

\subsection{Parsing}
To parse is a to check if some given input corresponds to a certain language's
grammar, and in this thesis it will use \textbf{context-free grammars} for
programming languages.

\subsection{Motivation}
In compilers, lexing and parsing are the two first phases. The output of these
is an abstract syntax tree (AST) which is fed to the next phase of the compiler.
But an AST could also provide useful feedback for programmers, already in their
editor, if the code could be lexed and parsed fast enough. With a lexer and
parser that is incremental and that can also be parallelized could real-time
feedback in the form of an AST easily be provided to the programmer. Most
current text editors give syntax feedback based on regular expressions, which
does not yield any information about depth or the surrounding AST.

Something something about connecting to a type-checker.

\section{Lexing}
* Describe what lexing is
* Shortly describe LexGen and its relevance.

\section{Context-free grammars}
What are context-free grammars? Perhaps something about LBNF and BNFC?

\subsection{Chomsky Normal Form}
Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a subset of context-free grammars that was first
described by linguist Noam Chomsky. Productions in CNF are restricted to the
following forms:

% TODO: add caption etc 
\begin{tabular}{l l l l}
    A & $\rightarrow$ & BC & A variable, B and C productions \\
    A & $\rightarrow$ & a & A variable, a nonterminal \\
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}

\section{Parsing}
\subsection{CYK algorithm}
\subsection{Valiant}
\subsection{Improvement by Bernardy \& Claessen}
Running time analysis. Oracle for list.

\section{Dependently typed programming}
What is dependently typed programming, and how can it be used in Haskell. How
about an example using vectors (standard example, sort of).
\subsection{Kinds, Types and Values}
Describe how kinds relate to types as types relate to values.
