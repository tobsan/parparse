parparse
========

Parsing CFG languages in parallel. This will combine work from MSc thesis done 
by *Hugo & Hansson* with the results from the paper by *Claessen & Bernardy*
about parallel parsing. Hopefully, the combined result will be an incremental
divide-and-conquer lexer and parser that can be used in text editors, such as
Yi.
