This repo was used to organize my master's thesis in 2014. The final thesis can be found here: http://hdl.handle.net/2077/36982. The title of the thesis is *Implementing incremental and parallel parsing*.

Introduction
------------
Parsing CFG languages in parallel. This will combine work from MSc thesis done 
by *Hugo & Hansson* with the results from the paper by *Claessen & Bernardy*
about parallel parsing. Hopefully, the combined result will be an incremental
divide-and-conquer lexer and parser that can be used in text editors, such as
Yi.
