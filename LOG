Log of progress, meetings etc
=============================

Notes 2014-01-31
================
* Parametrization of LexGen results were successful, it forced some new
  constraints to many functions, but looks good otherwise.
  NOTE: This was not obvious to me, but neccessary in order to make the results
        work incrementally.

* Now we more or less want to use the tables from bnfc --cnf to see what parts
  we can use to see if we have A0A1 \elem P.

* We want sigma to be measure and A0A1 \elem P as mappend.

Supervision 2014-01-27
======================
* We don't want to do measure . measure, but rather have LexGen store its result
  as FingerTree instead of Seq IntToken, so that we can measure it with our own
  measure function (matrix stuff)

* BNFC rules are generated by BNFC/Backend/Haskell/ToCNF.hs and
                                          /Haskell.hs

* For the planning report, these logs with sugar can be used, more or less.

Supervision 2014-01-14
======================

* Discussions about setup of repo, supervision, expectations etc
    - Supervision mondays
    - Approx 2 months work, 2 months report writing
    - Midway report around easter

* Guidelines for the report
    - Should be readable by other MSc students
    - Should contain everything interesting/non-obvious

* Things to think about in the actual project
    - How to handle wrong input
        - And how to know what part is bad?
        - Overlaps in matrix - decision needed!
    - How to combine lexer and parser neatly w/ Monoid & Measure
        - This is the first large challenge!
        - Once done - test it as simple as possible.

* Where to find code?
    - BNFC
    - LexGen
    - Yi

Project start 2014-01-13 - 14
========================
* Reading paper by Valiant
* Reading paper by Claessen & Bernardy
* Walkthrough of LexGen by Kristofer
