Log of progress, meetings etc
=============================

Supervision 2014-01-27
======================
* We don't want to do measure . measure, but rather have LexGen store its result
  as FingerTree instead of Seq IntToken, so that we can measure it with our own
  measure function (matrix stuff)

* BNFC rules are generated by BNFC/Backend/Haskell/ToCNF.hs and
                                          /Haskell.hs

* For the planning report, these logs with sugar can be used, more or less.

Supervision 2014-01-14
======================

* Discussions about setup of repo, supervision, expectations etc
    - Supervision mondays
    - Approx 2 months work, 2 months report writing
    - Midway report around easter

* Guidelines for the report
    - Should be readable by other MSc students
    - Should contain everything interesting/non-obvious

* Things to think about in the actual project
    - How to handle wrong input
        - And how to know what part is bad?
        - Overlaps in matrix - decision needed!
    - How to combine lexer and parser neatly w/ Monoid & Measure
        - This is the first large challenge!
        - Once done - test it as simple as possible.

* Where to find code?
    - BNFC
    - LexGen
    - Yi

Project start 2014-01-13 - 14
========================
* Reading paper by Valiant
* Reading paper by Claessen & Bernardy
* Walkthrough of LexGen by Kristofer
